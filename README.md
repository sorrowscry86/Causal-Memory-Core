## 🌟 Overview

Causal Memory Core transforms flat event lists into interconnected causal narratives, enabling AI agents to understand not just *what* happened, but *why* it happened and how events relate to each other.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🔗 Narrative Chain Reconstruction**: Automatically traces causal relationships from any event back to root causes
- **🧠 Semantic Search with Causal Context**: Find events and receive complete causal stories, not just isolated facts
- **⚡ Real-time Causal Detection**: LLM-powered analysis determines relationships between events as they occur
- **🔌 MCP Integration**: Ready for integration with AI agents through Model Context Protocol (v1.1.0)
- **📊 DuckDB Backend**: High-performance, embedded database for fast queries
- **🤖 OpenAI Integration**: Leverages GPT models for intelligent event analysis
- **🐳 Docker Support**: Production-ready containerization with docker-compose

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sorrowscry86/Causal-Memory-Core.git
   cd Causal-Memory-Core
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   # Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

### 🐳 Docker Deployment

1. **Using Docker Compose (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   # Set your OpenAI API key
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   
   # Build and run
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Using Docker directly:**

   ```bash
   # Build the image
   docker build -t causal-memory-core:1.1.0 .
   
   # Run the container
   docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here \
              -v causal_memory_data:/app/data \
              causal-memory-core:1.1.0
   ```

### Usage Examples

#### 🔥 Basic Usage

```python
from src.causal_memory_core import CausalMemoryCore

# Initialize the memory system
memory = CausalMemoryCore()

# Record events
memory.add_event("User opened the application")
memory.add_event("User selected a document")
memory.add_event("Document loaded successfully")

# Query causal context
context = memory.get_context("document loading")
print(context)
```

#### 🖥️ CLI Interface

```bash
# Add events via CLI
python cli.py --add "Project meeting scheduled"
python cli.py --add "Team assigned to project"

# Query for context
python cli.py --query "project status"
```

#### 🔌 MCP Server Mode (v1.1.0)

```bash
# Start MCP server
python src/mcp_server.py

# Server will be available for MCP client connections
```

## Example Usage

### Narrative Output Format (v1.1.0)

When you query the system, you get complete causal stories:

```text
Query: "How was the login bug resolved?"

Response: "Initially, a bug report was filed for 'User login fails with 500 error'. 
This led to the production server logs being inspected, revealing a NullPointerException, 
which in turn caused the UserAuthentication service code to be reviewed, identifying a missing null check. 
This led to a patch being written to add the necessary null check, 
which in turn caused the patch to be successfully deployed to production, and the bug was marked as resolved."
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Event Input] --> B[Causal Analysis Engine]
    B --> C[DuckDB Storage]
    B --> D[OpenAI Processing]
    C --> E[Semantic Search]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Context Retrieval]
    F --> G[Causal Narrative Output]
```

- **Event recording:** `add_event()` stores events and detects causal links automatically.
- **Narrative retrieval:** `get_context()` reconstructs complete causal chains as chronological narratives.
- **Causal chain traversal:** System follows cause_id links backward to root events, then formats as story.
- **Config:** All settings in `config.py` (thresholds, model names, etc).

## MCP Integration (v1.1.0)

The system exposes two primary tools via Model Context Protocol:

- **`add_event(effect: str)`**: Records events with automatic causal relationship detection
- **`query(query: str) -> str`**: Returns complete narrative chains related to the query

Perfect for AI agents that need persistent memory with causal reasoning capabilities.

## 🔧 Configuration

All configuration options are available in `config.py`:

```python
# Core settings
DB_PATH = "causal_memory.db"
LLM_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.5

# MCP Server settings (v1.1.0)
MCP_SERVER_VERSION = "1.1.0"
MCP_SERVER_NAME = "causal-memory-core"

# Performance tuning
MAX_POTENTIAL_CAUSES = 5
TIME_DECAY_HOURS = 24
```

## Testing

Our comprehensive testing suite ensures reliability and performance:

### Test Coverage

- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Core functionality validation
- ✅ **E2E Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: MCP server and external tool compatibility
- ✅ **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/test_memory_core.py -v

# End-to-end tests
python -m pytest tests/e2e/ -v

# Full test suite
python run_comprehensive_tests.py

# Coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=src tests/
```

### Recent Test Results

**Test Status**: 2 failed, 127 passed (98% pass rate)

The remaining 2 failures only occur during full suite execution due to minor test isolation issues - both tests pass when run individually, indicating the core functionality is sound.

| Test Category | Events Recorded | Query Success Rate | Integration Status |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| File Operations | 4/4 (100%) | 4/5 (80%) | ✅ Desktop Commander |
| Information Retrieval | 5/5 (100%) | 3/4 (75%) | ✅ Web Search Tools |
| External Integration | 9/9 (100%) | 1/1 (100%) | ✅ GitHub MCP |

## 📊 Performance
