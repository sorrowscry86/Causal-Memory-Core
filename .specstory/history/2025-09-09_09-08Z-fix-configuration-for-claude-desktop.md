fix configuration for claude desktop

---

_**Assistant**_

To help you fix the configuration for Claude Desktop, I need to know what specific issue or error you are experiencing with the `claude_desktop_config.json` file. Could you please describe the problem or share any error messages you are seeing? This will help me provide an accurate fix.

---

_**User (2025-09-09 11:48Z)**_

This may help

---

_**Assistant**_

The error message indicates that in your `claude_desktop_config.json`, the field at path `mcpServers.pieces.command` is missing or set to `undefined`, but it is required and must be a string.

To fix this, you need to add a valid string value for the `command` field under `mcpServers > pieces`. Here’s an example of what the relevant section should look like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pieces": {
      "command": "your-command-here"
      // ...other fields...
    }
    // ...other servers...
  }
  // ...other config...
}
```

Replace `"your-command-here"` with the appropriate command for your setup (for example, `"python mcp_server.py"` or another executable string).

Would you like me to update the file with a placeholder value, or do you know the exact command to use?

_**User (2025-09-09 11:49Z)**_

look online

---

_**Assistant**_

Online sources did not provide a direct example, but based on the error and common config patterns, your `claude_desktop_config.json` must include a string value for `mcpServers.pieces.command`.

A typical configuration might look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pieces": {
      "command": "python mcp_server.py"
      // ...other fields as needed...
    }
    // ...other servers...
  }
  // ...other config...
}
```

You should replace `"python mcp_server.py"` with the actual command needed for your environment. If you want, I can update your config file with a placeholder so the app loads and you can edit it later. Would you like me to proceed with this fix?

https://docs.pieces.app/products/cli/get-started

---

_**Assistant**_

The official documentation does not provide a direct example of the `claude_desktop_config.json` structure, but based on your error and the MCP server info in your screenshot, here is a recommended fix:

You need to ensure that under `mcpServers > pieces`, there is a `command` field with a valid string value. For PiecesOS and CLI, a typical command might be:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pieces": {
      "command": "pieces run"
      // ...other fields as needed...
    }
    // ...other servers...
  }
  // ...other config...
}
```

If you are running a local MCP server, you may need to specify the command that starts it, such as `"python mcp_server.py"` or the actual executable.

Would you like me to update your config file with `"pieces run"` as the command, or do you want to specify a different command?

_**User (2025-09-09 12:06Z)**_

need to install the CLI

---

_**Assistant**_

It looks like `pip` is not recognized in your PowerShell, which means Python and/or pip may not be installed or added to your PATH.

To fix this:
1. Make sure Python is installed. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. During installation, check the box "Add Python to PATH".
3. After installation, restart PowerShell and run:
```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install pieces-cli
```

Would you like step-by-step instructions for installing Python and pip?

_**Assistant**_

The warning means the `pieces.exe` (and other scripts) were installed, but their directory is not in your system PATH. This prevents you from running `pieces` directly in PowerShell.

To fix this:
1. Add `` to your PATH environment variable.
2. After updating PATH, restart PowerShell or your computer.
3. You should then be able to run `pieces` from any terminal.

_**User (2025-09-09 12:17Z)**_

how do I add it to path

---

_**Assistant**_

Here’s how to add the folder to your PATH on Windows:

1. Press `Win + S` and type “Environment Variables”, then select “Edit the system environment variables”.
2. In the System Properties window, click the “Environment Variables…” button.
3. In the Environment Variables window, under “User variables” (or “System variables” if you want it for all users), find and select the “Path” variable, then click “Edit…”.
4. Click “New” and paste this path:
```
C:\Users\Wykeve\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python313\Scripts
```
5. Click “OK” on all windows to save and close.
6. Restart PowerShell or your computer.

After this, you should be able to run `pieces` and other installed scripts from any terminal.

_**Assistant**_

Here is the official configuration for integrating Pieces MCP with Claude Desktop (from the documentation):

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`, replacing `<YourUser>` with your actual Windows username and adjusting the Python version if needed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Pieces": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\Wykeve\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0\\LocalCache\\local-packages\\Python313\\Scripts\\pieces.exe",
      "args": [
        "--ignore-onboarding",
        "mcp",
        "start"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Steps:
1. Make sure the path to `pieces.exe` matches your installation.
2. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop.

Alternatively, you can run this command in PowerShell for automatic setup:
```
pieces mcp setup --claude
```
This will auto-configure the MCP server for Claude Desktop.
