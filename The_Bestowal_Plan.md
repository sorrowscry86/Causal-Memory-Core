# The Bestowal Plan: Causal Memory Core Integration with Albedo

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Target Albedo Version:** Compatible with MCP 0.9.0+  
**CMC Version:** 1.1.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

## Executive Summary

The Causal Memory Core (CMC) has successfully completed The Grand Triptych of Refinement and is ready for integration with Albedo as its primary memory and reasoning substrate. This document outlines the precise steps for integrating the newly empowered CMC into Albedo's cognitive protocol, prioritizing narrative causal reasoning above all other data sources.

## Integration Architecture

### Core Principle: Memory-First Reasoning

Albedo shall operate under the **Memory-First Protocol**: Before taking any action or making any decision, Albedo must first query the CMC for relevant causal context. This ensures all actions are informed by the complete narrative history, not just isolated facts.

### MCP Integration Points

The CMC exposes two critical tools via Model Context Protocol:

1. **`add_event(effect: str)`**: Records every significant action, observation, or decision made by Albedo
2. **`query(query: str) -> str`**: Retrieves complete causal narratives related to any topic or decision point

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: MCP Server Integration (Week 1)

1. **Configure MCP Connection**
   - Add causal-memory-core to Albedo's MCP server configuration
   - Set connection parameters:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "causal-memory-core",
       "command": "python",
       "args": ["src/mcp_server.py"],
       "cwd": "/path/to/causal-memory-core"
     }
     ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is accessible to CMC
   - Configure database path for persistent storage
   - Test MCP connection with basic add/query operations

### Phase 2: Core Protocol Modification (Week 2)

1. **Implement Memory-First Decision Framework**
   
   Before any action, Albedo must execute this sequence:
   
   ```
   1. QUERY: Search CMC for relevant context about the current situation
   2. ANALYZE: Parse the returned narrative for causal patterns and constraints
   3. CONTEXTUALIZE: Use narrative insights to inform decision-making
   4. ACT: Execute the action with full causal awareness
   5. RECORD: Add the action and its outcome to CMC via add_event
   ```

2. **Narrative Context Parser**
   
   Develop logic to parse CMC narrative responses and extract:
   - Root causes of current situations
   - Previous attempts and their outcomes
   - Causal patterns that may repeat
   - Dependencies and prerequisites

### Phase 3: Behavioral Integration (Week 3)

1. **Query Templates for Common Scenarios**
   
   - **Problem Diagnosis**: "What led to [current problem/error]?"
   - **Solution Selection**: "What previous solutions were tried for similar issues?"
   - **Risk Assessment**: "What unintended consequences occurred when [similar action] was taken?"
   - **Context Building**: "What is the complete story behind [current situation]?"

2. **Event Recording Patterns**
   
   Automatically record events for:
   - Every command executed
   - Every decision made with rationale
   - Every error encountered and resolution attempt
   - Every successful completion of a task
   - Every user interaction and its outcome

### Phase 4: Advanced Causal Reasoning (Week 4)

1. **Multi-Step Planning with Causal Awareness**
   
   When planning complex tasks:
   - Query for previous attempts at similar tasks
   - Identify what caused failures in past attempts
   - Plan around known causal failure points
   - Build redundancy for critical causal dependencies

2. **Proactive Context Sharing**
   
   Before engaging with other systems or users:
   - Query for relevant background context
   - Share complete causal narratives when explaining decisions
   - Provide root cause analysis automatically when issues arise

## Configuration Parameters

### Recommended CMC Settings for Albedo

```python
# Enhanced settings for Albedo integration
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.6  # Higher threshold for more precise matches
MAX_POTENTIAL_CAUSES = 7    # More causes for complex scenarios
TIME_DECAY_HOURS = 168      # 1 week memory for long-term patterns
LLM_MODEL = "gpt-4"         # Higher accuracy for critical decisions
```

### Albedo Integration Settings

```python
# Memory-first protocol settings
MANDATORY_CONTEXT_QUERY = True      # Must query before major actions
AUTO_EVENT_RECORDING = True         # Automatically record all actions
NARRATIVE_EXPLANATION_MODE = True   # Include causal context in responses
MIN_CONTEXT_LENGTH = 50             # Minimum narrative length for decisions
```

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Measures

1. **Context Query Rate**: >90% of actions preceded by CMC query
2. **Event Recording Completeness**: >95% of actions recorded in CMC
3. **Narrative Utilization**: >80% of decisions reference retrieved narratives
4. **Causal Chain Length**: Average narrative chains of 3+ events
5. **Response Time**: Context queries complete within 500ms

### Qualitative Measures

1. **Decision Quality**: Improved decision-making based on historical context
2. **Error Reduction**: Fewer repeated mistakes due to causal awareness
3. **Explanation Quality**: Richer, more contextual explanations to users
4. **Learning Acceleration**: Faster adaptation based on causal patterns
5. **User Satisfaction**: Enhanced user experience through informed responses

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Safeguards

- **Query Timeout**: 10-second maximum for CMC queries
- **Fallback Mode**: Operate without memory if CMC unavailable
- **Cache Strategy**: Local cache for frequently accessed narratives
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking event recording

### Data Integrity

- **Backup Strategy**: Daily database backups to prevent data loss
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent access gracefully
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation when CMC encounters errors
- **Privacy Protection**: Ensure sensitive data handling compliance
