# Causal Memory Core: Team Onboarding

## 1. Project Mission

The Causal Memory Core is a Python-based memory system for AI agents. Its goal is to provide agents with a deeper understanding of event sequences by combining semantic search with causal reasoning. This allows an agent to ask "why" something happened and receive a narrative answer.

Our architecture is built around a portable DuckDB database, `sentence-transformers` for embeddings, and an LLM (like OpenAI's GPT series) for causal analysis.

The core logic is in `src/causal_memory_core.py`.

## 2. Getting Started (Platform Agnostic)

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Python 3.8+ OR Docker
- An OpenAI API key

### Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sorrowscry86/Causal-Memory-Core.git
    cd Causal-Memory-Core
    ```

2.  **Configure your environment:**
    Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env` and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
    ```bash
    cp .env.template .env
    # Now, edit the .env file with your key.
    ```
    This file is git-ignored, so your key will remain private.

## 3. How to Run

### Using Docker (Recommended for consistency)
The most straightforward way to run the application is with Docker.

```bash
# This builds the image and starts the API server.
docker-compose up --build
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Local Python Environment
If you prefer a local setup:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the application:**
    -   **As a library:** Import `CausalMemoryCore` into your own Python scripts. See `example_usage.py`.
    -   **Via CLI:** Use `cli.py` for quick interactions.
        ```bash
        # Add an event
        python cli.py --add "A new user registered."
        # Get context
        python cli.py --query "What was the last user action?"
        ```
    -   **As a server:** Run the API or MCP server.
        ```bash
        # For a REST API
        python src/api_server.py

        # For the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server
        python src/mcp_server.py
        ```

## 4. Development & Contribution Guidelines

### Testing is Mandatory
We use `pytest`. Before submitting any changes, ensure all tests pass.

```bash
# Run the primary test suite
python -m pytest tests/test_memory_core.py

# Run the complete test suite
python -m pytest tests/
```
